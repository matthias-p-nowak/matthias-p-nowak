👋 Hi, I’m Matthias Peter Nowak \
👀 Coding has been my passion for almost 40 years. It started with Pascal and my latest addition is golang \
🌱 I like Hugo (not the movie, but the software for static web sites). Created the Helios theme \
📖 learning C# (new edition) for HL7 pipehat and interaction with MS-SQL \
👍 light mode - I had dark modes for years on amber and green displays \
there is alway more to learn.
