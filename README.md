👋 Hi, I’m Matthias Peter Nowak \
👀 Coding has been my passion for almost 40 years. It started with Pascal \
🌱 I like Hugo (not the movie, but the software for static web sites) and created the Helios theme \
📖 learned C# again for HL7 pipehat and interaction with MS-SQL \
👍 light mode - I had dark modes for years on amber and green displays \
there is alway more to learn.

I have a small [blog](https://mefju7.priv.no/blog) which I use as a pensive for storing small snippets and ideas.

[my nuget packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=matthias77) using reflection. CmdLineArgs puts supplied values into fields and properties indicated by attributes. The CliUI project failed due to the inconsistent behavior of different terminals in windows and no way to determine which one is which from CSharp.
